You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.


Sample Input:

N            P
1            2
3            2
6            8
9            8 
2            5 
8            5 
5            NULL

****************************SOLUTION******************************

SELECT CASE
    WHEN P IS NULL THEN CONCAT(N, ' Root')
    WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM BST) THEN CONCAT(N, ' Inner')
    ELSE CONCAT(N, ' Leaf')
    END
FROM BST
ORDER BY N ASC
