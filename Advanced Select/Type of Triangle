Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

COLUMN   TYPE
A        INTEGER
B        INTEGER
C        INTEGER 

********************************SOLUTION************************************

Select CASE
            WHEN A + B > C and B + C > A and C + A > B  Then 
              Case
                when A = B and B = C then 'Equilateral'
                when A = B or B = C or A = C then 'Isosceles'
                else 'Scalene' 
              end 
            else 'Not A Triangle '
       END 
From TRIANGLES;
